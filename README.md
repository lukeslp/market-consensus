A stock prediction terminal that runs a staged multi-provider swarm debate on a configurable cycle. Providers debate at discovery, analysis, council voting, and synthesis. Accuracy is measured against actual closing prices and tracked indefinitely.

## Features

- **Democratic provider swarm** — providers participate in `core` (xAI, Gemini), `join` (Anthropic, OpenAI, Perplexity), and `side` (Mistral, Cohere) stages
- **Sub-agent analysis** — each provider can run internal specialist sub-agents, then emit a provider-level vote with reasoning
- **Council + synthesis voting** — weighted democratic votes happen twice: analyst council vote and final synthesis vote across all providers
- **Continuous cycles** — a background daemon thread runs prediction cycles on a configurable interval; each cycle discovers stocks, fetches live prices via yfinance, and logs everything to SQLite
- **Accuracy tracking** — predictions are evaluated against actual closing prices after the 7-day target window; per-provider accuracy stats accumulate over time
- **Real-time dashboard** — D3.js v7 visualizations stream live events over SSE; no page refresh needed to watch a cycle run
- **Oracle Terminal aesthetic** — Cinzel display font, JetBrains Mono for data, amber accent on near-black
- **Persistent SQLite store** — WAL mode for concurrent reads during background writes; six normalized tables; no external database required

## Configuration

All settings are environment variables with sensible defaults.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `PORT` | `5062` | Server port |
| `DB_PATH` | `foresight.db` | SQLite database file |
| `MARKET_TIMEZONE` | `America/New_York` | Market schedule timezone |
| `MARKET_OPEN_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `1800` | Run cadence while market is open (30 minutes) |
| `OVERNIGHT_CHECK_TIMES` | `20:00,06:00` | Two overnight refresh runs before next open |
| `OVERNIGHT_LOOKAHEAD_HOURS` | `18` | Only run overnight checks when next open is close enough |
| `SCHEDULE_POLL_SECONDS` | `20` | Worker polling granularity for scheduled runs |
| `CYCLE_INTERVAL` | `1800` | Legacy compatibility var; used as fallback for market-open cadence |
| `MAX_STOCKS` | `10` | Stocks to discover per cycle |
| `LOOKBACK_DAYS` | `30` | Historical price window sent to each analyst |
| `DISCOVERY_PROVIDER` | `mistral` | Preferred default provider for non-swarm discovery fallback |
| `PREDICTION_PROVIDER` | `anthropic` | Preferred default provider for non-swarm prediction fallback |
| `SYNTHESIS_PROVIDER` | `gemini` | Preferred default provider for non-swarm confidence synthesis fallback |

Model overrides (set in `app/config.py`):

| Provider | Default model |
|----------|--------------|
| xai | `grok-2-1212` |
| anthropic | `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` |
| gemini | `gemini-2.0-flash` |
| mistral | `mistral-large-latest` |
| perplexity | `sonar` |

## Scheduler Behavior

- During market hours (default `09:30-16:00` ET on weekdays), the worker runs a new cycle every 30 minutes.
- During closed hours, the worker runs two low-frequency refresh cycles (`20:00` and `06:00` ET by default) to refresh news/catalyst context before the next open.
- Weekend behavior follows the same logic and naturally schedules pre-open refreshes for Monday (for example, Sunday evening + Monday early morning).

## Prediction Cycle

Each cycle runs through four democratic phases in sequence.

### Phase 1 — Discovery

Providers vote on discovery candidates by stage (`core`, `join`, `side`), and each provider can run internal discovery sub-agents. The system combines results into a weighted symbol shortlist.

### Phase 2 — Validation

Each symbol is validated via yfinance. Symbols that cannot be fetched, return no price history, or are otherwise malformed are silently dropped. Valid symbols are written to the `stocks` table and their current prices are recorded in `prices`.

### Phase 3 — Multi-Model Debate

For each surviving symbol, providers are called by stage:

| Stage | Providers | Role |
|------|-----------|------|
| Core | xAI, Gemini | fast low-cost first-pass analysis |
| Join | Anthropic, OpenAI, Perplexity | deep reasoning and grounded context |
| Side | Mistral, Cohere | additional diversity and dissent |

Each analyst receives the ticker symbol, current price, and the last 10 closing prices. Each returns a JSON object with `prediction` (UP/DOWN/NEUTRAL), `confidence` (0.0–1.0), and `reasoning`.

All four reports are stored individually in the `predictions` table.

### Phase 4 — Democratic Synthesis

All providers cast final synthesis votes using the full debate transcript. Those votes are weighted and persisted as `*-synthesis`, then aggregated into `council-swarm-consensus`.

The cycle is then marked `completed` and a `cycle_complete` SSE event is broadcast to all connected clients.

### Database Schema

Six tables managed by `ForesightDB` in `db.py`:

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `cycles` | One row per prediction cycle; status: `active`, `completed`, `failed` |
| `stocks` | Global ticker registry, deduplicated (`UNIQUE COLLATE NOCASE`) |
| `prices` | Price snapshots per stock per cycle, used for accuracy evaluation |
| `predictions` | Per-provider directional predictions, per-provider synthesis votes (`*-synthesis`), and final consensus rows (`*-consensus`) |
| `accuracy_stats` | Aggregate win/loss counts and accuracy ratios per provider |
| `events` | SSE event queue; populated automatically by DB write methods |

SSE events are emitted by the database layer, not by the worker — `create_cycle`, `complete_cycle`, `add_stock`, and `add_prediction` each emit their corresponding event automatically.

### SSE Streaming

`GET /api/stream` — long-lived connection, one event per database write.

Event types: `connected`, `heartbeat`, `cycle_start`, `cycle_complete`, `prediction`, `price_update`.

## Tests

```bash
# All tests
./run_tests.sh all

# By category
./run_tests.sh unit
./run_tests.sh integration
./run_tests.sh api
./run_tests.sh db

# Coverage report (HTML output to htmlcov/)
./run_tests.sh coverage

# Single file
./run_tests.sh file tests/test_services.py
```

The test suite covers the database layer, both services, all API endpoints, and end-to-end cycle execution. The background worker is disabled in `TESTING` mode; integration tests trigger cycles manually via the API.

Key fixtures in `tests/conftest.py`:

| Fixture | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `db` | Fresh `ForesightDB` with temp file, reset before each test |
| `mock_provider` | Mock with `.complete()` returning a canned UP/0.75 JSON response |
| `mock_provider_factory` | Monkeypatches `ProviderFactory.get_provider` |
| `mock_yfinance` | Monkeypatches `app.services.stock_service.yf` |
| `sample_cycle` / `sample_stock` / `sample_prediction` | Pre-populated DB records |
